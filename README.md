The simplest possible experience to onboard pre-nostr people to Nostr.

To setup the build for native desktop and mobile platforms, more work is required. Documentation coming "soon".

## Start

```sh
yarn web
yarn desktop
yarn android

# You can specify the host, if needed.
yarn android --host 192.168.x.x
